Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### `yarn start`

Runs the project in development/watch mode. Your project will be rebuilt upon changes. Error messages are pretty printed and formatted for compatibility VS Code's Problems tab. Your library will be rebuilt if you make edits.

### `yarn build`

Bundles the package to the `dist` folder.
The package is optimized and bundled with Rollup into multiple formats (CommonJS, UMD, and ES Module).


### `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
